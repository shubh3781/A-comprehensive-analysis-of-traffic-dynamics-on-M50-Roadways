A comprehensive analysis of traffic dynamics on M50 Roadways


Vehicle Category Usage: The first question aims to analyze the usage of the Irish road network by calculating the percentage of traffic volume grouped by vehicle category. This analysis could provide insights into the types of vehicles that predominantly use these roads.

Hourly Traffic Flow on M50: This part of the assignment looks at identifying the hours which have the highest and lowest traffic flows on the M50, including the total number of vehicle counts. Such analysis helps in understanding traffic density and peak traffic hours.

Rush Hour Analysis on M50: The assignment further delves into calculating the morning and evening rush hours on the M50, showing the specific hours and the total vehicle counts. This analysis is crucial for understanding traffic patterns and planning for congestion mitigation.

Average Speed Between Junctions on M50: This question requires the calculation of the average speed between each junction on the M50 (e.g., junction 1 to junction 2, junction 2 to junction 3, etc.), providing insights into traffic flow and potential bottlenecks along the route.

Top 10 Locations for HGV Counts: The final question focuses on identifying the top 10 locations with the highest counts of Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs), mapping these counts to specific locations (COSITs) provided on a map. This analysis is aimed at understanding the distribution of heavy vehicle traffic, which can have significant implications for road maintenance and traffic management.

Each of these questions contributes to a comprehensive analysis of traffic dynamics on the Irish road network, specifically focusing on the M50. The findings from these analyses could be instrumental in informing traffic management strategies and infrastructure planning to accommodate varying vehicle types and manage peak traffic periods effectively.
